# Cpp Command Line Calculator

## Project Description
This is a simple calculator. The user interface is a command line interface where users will type in the expressions they want to calculate and the command line terminal will output the expression result.


## Instructions Guide
1. Run the Visual Studio solution. I am using Visual Studio 2022 but I believe that it will work on all visual studios as long as it is C++20 and above
2. Type in a mathematical expression. For example: 5 + 10
3. Press enter and see the result


## Operations Available
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exponential (^)
6. Square Root (r)
7. Negation (~)

## Additional Information
You may type in *h* or *H* to get the previous expression calculated

## Testing
In the main.cpp, I have a function that will run through a few couple of tests and see if it passes. The result of that test will indicate in the output. The tests goes through the different operations and also different invalid inputs to see if the calculator will reject the outputs.
